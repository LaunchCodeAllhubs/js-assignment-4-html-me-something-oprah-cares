       <p>"[...] All those weird reactors on the North West Bank and just so happens -- oops! that's also a garbage place. What if they're turning our tampons into energy and not paying us for it?! <br>
        Why isn't the government buying my trash? ...I need a beer. It's Monday." <br>

      <h2>I am running out of things to talk about.</h2>
      <p>
        I currently work at a local fast-casual restaraunt (resturant?) in St. Louis. I was taking a man's order at the register who was with his kid. The kid proceeds to pry open the door of the tip box we have and then tell me he's going to steal money out of it. His dad did nothing. <br>
        My good friend is visiting here for a while. She's from here but moved to LA and is an actress in a Nickelodeon show. She's not working right now because she's on strike. (Good for her!)<br>
